"""
DataStack: one private S3 bucket for the pipeline's data (inputs, outputs,
briefs) once it runs in AWS.

Safe by default, each line on purpose:
  - encrypted at rest (S3-managed keys)
  - no public access, ever (all four "block public access" switches on)
  - HTTPS only (a bucket policy refuses plain HTTP)
  - versioned: an overwrite or delete keeps the old copy, so a bad run can be
    rolled back; old copies expire after [aws] keep_old_versions_days
  - kept if the stack is deleted (RETAIN): data outlives the code that made it
